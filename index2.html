        <h1><i>About Me</i></h1>
        <section class="section1">
        <p>
          My name is <b>Temidayo Kehinde</b>. A lover of Technology and a budding
          Front-End Developer here at Stutern Graduate Accelerator. My love for
          technology started from my early childhood days. I grew up being
          curious about the workings of electronic devices and would always find
          myself repairing damaged DVD players, electronic cookers, sockets and
          whatever I could lay my hands on. And oh, Yes! These devices would
          work for a while before finally deciding to go to the land of the
          <i>dead</i> dead. Electronics fascinated me to no end. I was also very
          good with phone devices and could operate any device even while I had
          none.
        </p>
        <p>
          One would think that with a background as mine, I would end up finding
          my way into the Science department and studying physics and whatnot.
          However, contrary to what one would think, I graduated with a B.Sc in
          Insurance from the University of Lagos. But a couple years later, I
          find myself drawn into the world of programming, all thanks to a
          friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world of programming is fascinating. Knowing I can solve everyday
          human problems with just a <q>few</q> lines of code amazes me.
          Building an e-commerce website for everyday grocery shopping, a
          calculator for basic calculations, a website that helps businesses
          connect with their customers and so on fills me with the utmost joy.

        <h3><i>What I Have Learned so Far</i></h3>
        <p>
          It's been an impactful couple of weeks learning at Stutern. So far, I
          have learnt that HTML has to do with the structure of the webpage
          while CSS has to do with its presentation. We were taught different
          HTML tags and CSS properties and values and how to use them
          appropriately. I have also learnt about Git and GitHub - creating a
          repository, forking, cloning, collaboration and basic git commands.

        <h3><i>The Difference between Paddings, Margins, and Borders</i></h3>
        <p>
          The difference between the three CSS Properties above is best
          explained using the CSS box model. The CSS Box Model illustrates
          padding, margin, and border using a stack of boxes of different sizes,
          with the smallest box being the content. The next size being the
          padding, and the box after that being the border, followed by the
          margin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The padding creates a space around the content, while the border, from
          its name is like a wall around the content(padding included), while
          the margin is the space between the border and other HTML elements.
